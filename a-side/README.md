# Ommega A-side Relay

Custom keystore implementation for remote TEE attestation relay (A-side).

This is a full keystore implementation that fully implements the AOSP AIDL
interface. It runs on the A-side device and, when remote mode is enabled,
forwards attestation / sign / decrypt to a B-side real hardware TEE through the
relay_server.

## How it works

- **Local mode** (`remote: false`): uses the bundled software keybox to mint
  attestation chains, like a regular keystore spoofer.
- **Remote mode** (`remote: true`): attestation (tag 709) is minted by the
  B-side real hardware TEE via the relay_server. Sign/decrypt for remote keys
  are forwarded too. Before the software TA starts, A obtains and freezes the
  B-side stable-AIDL version/hash, canonical profile version, vendor hardware
  version, security level, and StrongBox availability. Every attestation result
  must match that profile. If the relay is temporarily unavailable during boot,
  startup retries until the remote profile is available instead of freezing a
  mismatched local profile. Profile or certificate mismatches fail closed unless
  explicit local fallback is enabled.

## Install and configure

**Android 12 or above required.**

1. Install this module (KernelSU/APatch, or Magisk).

2. Configure `/data/adb/ommega/config` (the single shared A-side config dir):

   ```
   url: http://<relay-server>:<port>
   device_id: <b-side-device-id>
   token: <relay-token>
   remote: true
   local_hw: true
   tls_insecure: true
   debug_logging: false
   ```

3. Add the apps you want to intercept to `/data/adb/ommega/target.txt`, one
   plain package name per line. The WebUI (`webroot/`) manages this and the
   optional per-package `global_default` / `strongbox` / `tee` policy stored in
   `/data/misc/keystore/ommega/target-security.toml`.

   The remote settings dialog also provides a global "disable native
   StrongBox" switch. It only affects target apps whose policy is
   `global_default`; explicit StrongBox or TEE choices take precedence. All
   target and policy changes are read live by the injector.

4. Replace the template `keybox.xml` if you want local-mode attestation with
   your own keys.

WebUI overlay values (verified boot hash, verified boot key, security patch)
are written to `/data/misc/keystore/ommega/webui-props.sh` and mirrored into
`config.toml` `[trust]` (`vb_hash`, `vb_key`, `security_patch`,
`vendor_patchlevel`, `boot_patchlevel`). Patch levels update the live TA;
verified boot hash/key changes automatically recycle only Ommega's keymint
child and wait for RPC recovery. No device reboot is required. Overlay-installing
the module zip does not wipe these values.

> **Path note**: `/data/adb/` is root-only, so the keystore process (uid 1017)
> cannot read `/data/adb/ommega/*` directly. `post-fs-data.sh` and the
> `daemon-injector` sync `config` and `target.txt` to
> `/data/misc/keystore/ommega/` automatically, so edits take effect without a
> reboot.

## Restarting keymint and injector

The module ships two background daemons: one for `keymint`, one for `injector`.
Restart them with:

```sh
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.keymint
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.injector
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.all
```

On each keymint start, its watchdog removes the previous RPC socket inode. The
injector installs its Binder hooks immediately so boot-time authorization and
maintenance events are captured even while remote identity and RPC startup are
still pending. RPC warm-up runs in the keystore2 process, and the in-memory
mirror queue replays captured state changes after the service becomes ready.
